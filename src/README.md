# Introduction

This book is a collection of programming notes which is personally collected from different sources and experiences for C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello C++ Community!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Purpose

Having a single source for C++ to remember syntax, rules, or code-snippets for special use-cases.
